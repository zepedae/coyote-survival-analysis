# Survival Responses of Coyotes to Urban Social and Environmental Characteristics

Understanding species responses to urbanization is key for gaining insights into 
the ecology and management of wildlife in these rapidly expanding environments. 
Survival is a critical process linking individual level responses like behavior 
to larger scale dynamics important for species and community persistence. We 
explored the effects of social and environmental characteristics of an urban environment on survival in coyotes. We found that natural habitat availability has a positive effect on survival in these urban coyotes and evidence that disturbed habitat, those with moderate levels of human disturbance, may increase survival as well. 

### Files
Data used in this study is the property of the Urban Coyote Research Project
and cannot be shared here. Below are descriptions of each file for those
looking to recreate the analysis with their own data.

* mortality.csv: contains data on the approximate date of death for coyotes 
recovered postmortem
* parent_pup_ids: approximate birth date and RFID of individuals who were 
captured as pups
* utm1.csv, utm2.csv: contains the UTM coordinates, date, and time of locations
collected from VHF collared animals
* finalRaster524.grd: a file containing geospatial social and environmental data
