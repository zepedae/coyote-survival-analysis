# Survival Responses of Coyotes to Urban Social and Environmental Characteristics

Understanding species responses to urbanization is key for gaining insights into 
the ecology and management of wildlife in these rapidly expanding environments. 
Survival is a critical process linking individual level responses like behavior 
to larger scale dynamics important for species and community persistence. We 
explored the effects of social and environmental characteristics of an urban environment on survival in coyotes. We found that natural habitat availability has a positive effect on survival in these urban coyotes and evidence that disturbed habitat, those with moderate levels of human disturbance, may increase survival as well. 

### Files
I do not have authorization to share the data used in the analysis; however,
I describe their contents below in case you want to recreate the analysis with
your own data.
~ mortality.csv: contains data on the approximate date of death for coyotes 
recovered postmortem
~ parent_pup_ids: approximate birth date and RFID of individuals who were 
captured as pups
~ utm1.csv, utm2.csv: contains the UTM coordinates, date, and time of locations
collected from VHF collared animals
~ finalRaster524.grd: a file containing geospatial social and environmental data
